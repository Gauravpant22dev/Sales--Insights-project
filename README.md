# Sales--Insights-project
End to End data analysis project using Python for cleaning and Power BI for visualization


​Overview:
​This project focuses on analyzing a Sales Database to extract meaningful business insights. I used Python for data processing and Power BI for creating the final visualization.

​Key Highlights:
​Data Cleaning: Processed the "Sales Database" files using Python (Pandas) to ensure data accuracy.
​Visualization: Developed an interactive Power BI Dashboard to track sales performance and KPIs.
​End-to-End Workflow: Demonstrated the full journey from raw data handling to visual storytelling.
